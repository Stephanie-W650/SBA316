Assignment:
You will create a small single-page web application. The topic and content of this application is entirely up to you; be creative!
Your work will be graded according to the technical requirements listed in the following section. Creativity and effort always work in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements if you have the time.
Keep things simple. Like most projects you will encounter, you should finish the absolute minimum requirements first, and then add additional features and complexity if you have the time to do so. This will also help you understand what you can get done in a specific allotment of time if you were to be asked to do something similar in the future.
Once you have an idea in mind, approach your design through the user's perspective. User experience is one of the most important aspects of successful web design. If users enjoy their time on with your application, they are more likely to trust whatever services or information you offer, and more likely to come back and use the application again in the future.

Requirement:
Cache at least one element using selectElementById.
Cache at least one element using querySelector or querySelectorAll.
Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements at least once (firstChild, lastChild, parentNode, nextElementSibling, etc.).
Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task.
Create at least one element using createElement.
Use appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM.
Use the DocumentFragment interface or HTML templating with the cloneNode method to create templated content. 
Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user interaction using innerHTML, innerText, or textContent.
Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user interactions using the style or classList properties.
Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction.
Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated event handler functions.
Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated event handler functions.
Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation.
Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based validation. (This can be the same form or input as the one above, but should include event-based validation in addition to the HTML attribute validation.)
Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).
Commit frequently to the git repository.
Include a README file that contains a description of your application.
Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.
